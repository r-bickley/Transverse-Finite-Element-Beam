This project contains four tools that can be used to analyze the physical responses of a transverse beam composed of a user-specified number of finite elements. Finite elements are mathematical subdivisions within a beam. These gain particular physical significance when the beam analyzed does not have uniform properties. For this exercise, however, the beam considered will have uniform properties throughout.

The first tool, k-gen, produces a stiffness matrix for a beam based on user-specified properties. These properties are the young's modulus of elasticity, the total length, the total mass, and the number of finite elements, or subdivisions.

The second tool, m-gen, produces a mass matrix for a beam based on user-specified properties.
